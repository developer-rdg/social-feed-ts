# React Web Project: Feed
## üìñ About the project
This project is a web application that replicates a social media "Feed" page. Users can engage with the content by commenting, liking posts, and performing other typical actions found on social networks. The main objective of this project is to enhance my skills and techniques in React Web development.

## üöÄ Technologies Used
The project was developed using the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

In this project, I used TypeScript for static typing and leveraged the power of declarative programming to create a more readable, maintainable, and clean codebase.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development Methodology
Following clean code principles is an essential aspect of this project. I ensured that the code is easy to read and understand, has fewer complexities, and follows industry-standard practices. Declarative programming was also a significant part of the development methodology, making the code more intuitive and focused on the what rather than the how.

Feel free to explore the project and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
